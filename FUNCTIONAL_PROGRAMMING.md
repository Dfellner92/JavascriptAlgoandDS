### Learn About Functional Programming

In the code editor, the `prepareTea` and `getTea` functions are already defined for you. Call the `getTea` function to get 40 cups of tea for the team, and store them in the `tea4TeamFCC` variable.

```javascript
// Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
const prepareTea = () => "greenTea";

/*
Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the
following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
*/
const getTea = (numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for (let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};

// Only change code below this line
const tea4TeamFCC = getTea(40);
console.log(tea4TeamFCC);
// Only change code above this line
```

### Understand Functional Programming Terminology

Prepare 27 cups of green tea and 13 cups of black tea and store them in `tea4GreenTeamFCC` and `tea4BlackTeamFCC` variables, respectively. Note that the `getTea` function has been modified so it now takes a function as the first argument.

```javascript
// Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
const prepareGreenTea = () => "greenTea";

// Function that returns a string representing a cup of black tea
const prepareBlackTea = () => "blackTea";

/*
Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the
following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
*/
const getTea = (prepareTea, numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for (let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};

// Only change code below this line
const tea4GreenTeamFCC = getTea(prepareGreenTea, 27);
const tea4BlackTeamFCC = getTea(prepareBlackTea, 13);
// Only change code above this line

console.log(tea4GreenTeamFCC, tea4BlackTeamFCC);
```

### Understand the Hazards of Using Imperative Code

### Avoid Mutations and Side Effects Using Functional Programming

Fill in the code for the function ```incrementer``` so it returns the value of the global variable ```fixedValue``` increased by one.

```javascript
// The global variable
var fixedValue = 4;

function incrementer () {
  // Only change code below this line
  let inc = fixedValue + 1;
  return inc;

  // Only change code above this line
}
```

### Pass Arguments to Avoid External Dependence in a Function

Let's update the ```incrementer``` function to clearly declare its dependencies.

Write the ```incrementer``` function so it takes an argument, and then returns a result after increasing the value by one.

```javascript
// The global variable
var fixedValue = 4;

// Only change code below this line
function incrementer (fixedValue) {
  return fixedValue + 1;

  // Only change code above this line
}
```

### Refactor Global Variables Out of Functions

Rewrite the code so the global array ```bookList``` is not changed inside either function. The ```add``` function should add the given ```bookName``` to the end of the array passed to it and return a new array (list). The ```remove``` function should remove the given ```bookName``` from the array passed to it.
