### Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable

Use the ```console.log()``` method to print the value of the variable ```a``` where noted in the code.

```javascript

let a = 5;
let b = 1;
a++;
// Only change code below this line

let sumAB = a + b;
console.log(sumAB);
```

### Understanding the Differences between the freeCodeCamp and Browser Console

First, use ```console.log``` to log the ```output``` variable. Then, use ```console.clear``` to clear the browser console.

```javascript 


```

### Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable

Add two ```console.log()``` statements to check the ```typeof``` each of the two variables ```seven``` and ```three``` in the code.

```javascript
let seven = 7;
let three = "3";
console.log(seven + three);
// Only change code below this line
console.log(typeof(seven));
console.log(typeof(three));
```
