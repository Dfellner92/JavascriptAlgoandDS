## **Debugging**

### Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable

Use the ```console.log()``` method to print the value of the variable ```a``` where noted in the code.

### Understanding the Differences between the freeCodeCamp and Browser Console

First, use ```console.log()``` to log the ```output()``` variable. Then, use ```console.clear``` to clear the browser console.

### Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable

Add two ```console.log()``` statements to check the ```typeof``` each of the two variables ```seven``` and ```three``` in the code.

### Catch Misspelled Variable and Function Names

Fix the two spelling errors in the code so the ```netWorkingCapital``` calculation works.

### Catch Unclosed Parentheses, Brackets, Braces and Quotes

Fix the two pair errors in the code.

### Catch Mixed Usage of Single and Double Quotes

Fix the string so it either uses different quotes for the ```href``` value, or escape the existing ones. Keep the double quote marks around the entire string.

### Catch Use of Assignment Operator Instead of Equality Operator

Fix the condition so the program runs the right branch, and the appropriate value is assigned to ```result```.
