## **Debugging**

### Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable

Use the ```console.log()``` method to print the value of the variable ```a``` where noted in the code.

### Understanding the Differences between the freeCodeCamp and Browser Console

First, use ```console.log()``` to log the ```output()``` variable. Then, use ```console.clear``` to clear the browser console.

### Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable

Add two ```console.log()``` statements to check the ```typeof``` each of the two variables ```seven``` and ```three``` in the code.

### Catch Misspelled Variable and Function Names

Fix the two spelling errors in the code so the ```netWorkingCapital``` calculation works.

### Catch Unclosed Parentheses, Brackets, Braces and Quotes

Fix the two pair errors in the code.

### Catch Mixed Usage of Single and Double Quotes

Fix the string so it either uses different quotes for the ```href``` value, or escape the existing ones. Keep the double quote marks around the entire string.

### Catch Use of Assignment Operator Instead of Equality Operator

Fix the condition so the program runs the right branch, and the appropriate value is assigned to ```result```.



## **Basic Data Structures**

### Iterate Through All an Array's Items Using For Loops

We have defined a function, ```filteredArray```, which takes ```arr```, a nested array, and ```elem``` as arguments, and returns a new array. ```elem``` represents an element that may or may not be present on one or more of the arrays nested within ```arr```. Modify the function, using a ```for``` loop, to return a filtered version of the passed array such that any array nested within ```arr``` containing ```elem``` has been removed.

### Create complex multi-dimensional arrays

We have defined a variable, ```myNestedArray```, set equal to an array. Modify ```myNestedArray```, using any combination of strings, numbers, and booleans for data elements, so that it has exactly five levels of depth (remember, the outer-most array is level 1). Somewhere on the third level, include the string ```deep```, on the fourth level, include the string ```deeper```, and on the fifth level, include the string ```deepest```.

### Add Key-Value Pairs to JavaScript Objects

A ```foods``` object has been created with three entries. Using the syntax of your choice, add three more entries to it: ```bananas``` with a value of ```13```, grapes with a value of ```35```, and ```strawberries``` with a value of ```27```.
